# BLOGLOBE Blog Platform

Project of blog platform using Spring and Hibernate for back end.

## About 
My BLOGLOBE blog platform is allowing its user to register and login, then to list and view all articles, check on other users, add new posts and edit older ones. All registered users have role of 'USER', which allow them to freely access almost all resources. Only admin (with role of 'ADMIN') can delete posts of other users. This is possible thanks to the Spring Security Framework. 

## Technologies
* Spring MVC,
* Spring Security,
* Hibernate ORM, Hibernate Validator,
* JSP,
* Maven,
* HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap 4,
* MySQL.

## Info
If someone doesn't want to register, there is default user of kajetan:test (login:password), which can be used to log in. If someone wants to feel power of admin, they can use admin:admin to login in.
